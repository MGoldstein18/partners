# Partners

This is a MERN stack web which, when complete, will be a tool to help people complete courses with the help of a partner. 

A user will be able to: 
 - Create an account
 - Add a course to their dashboard 
 - Search for their partners via email and add them as a partner on their course
 - Track and collaborate with a partner on their course

## What we have done so far:
1. Created an Express server which is connected to a MongoDB database
2. Created a user model which, at this stage, contains only the username, password and arrays for partner requests sent, received and approved. 
3. Created a controller file and added function for create a user, send and approve partner requests
4. Routes have been added and functions have been tested using Postman

## What we are doing next:
1. 2F authentication 
2. Start on the front end - Home page, sign up, log in, send/receive requests
3. Additional details for each user profile
4. Connection to courses
